The JSON file you've provided appears to be the configuration for a Firebase web app, not a service account key file. 

A service account key file is different and is used for server-to-server interactions. It contains sensitive information including a private key and is used to authenticate your server with Firebase. 

#### in Firebase

You can generate a new service account key file from the Firebase console by following these steps:

1. Go to the Firebase console.
2. Click on your project.
3. Click on the gear icon on the left side to open the settings, and then click on "Project settings".
4. Click on the "Service accounts" tab.
5. Click on the "Generate new private key" button. This will download a new JSON file.

This new JSON file is your service account key file. It should look similar to the example I provided in the previous message. Use this file in your Python script to authenticate with Firebase. 

Remember to keep this file secure and do not share it or commit it to version control systems like Git.
